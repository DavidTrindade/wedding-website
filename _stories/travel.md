## Travel Announcement

For the Hindu Wedding on Thursday 4th, please try and arrive by 9:45am at the latest to have enough time to eat before the ceremony starts, thank you!

For the reception on Saturday 6th September, please try and arrive by 6:30pm at the latest, thank you!

And finally, this might be called off still during the week but for now there are tube strikes happening and it looks like there will be no underground service on Saturday 6th September. 

If you are travelling by public transport, bus and train (Hounslow station) should still be ok but please check. 

The roads also may be busier due to strikes so please allow more time for travel!
